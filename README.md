# Budgeting Android Application

A budgeting application that I made as my first foray into Java and ultimately Android Programming. This was mainly done by myself yet I did have a source of help from one of my friends.

To summerise, an All In One budgeting and saving platform that allows the user to keep track of their expenses. This was a massive undertaking for me and I believe that I ended with some good learnings and experience in this field to utilise later down in my life.

## Recording Transactions
You can add income and expense through the floating add button at the bottom of the home screen. The recorded income and expense can be seen in the income and expense tabs located at the top of the home screen. To edit or delete a recorded transaction, click on it and select delete or edit.
## Data Analytics
Income, expense and overall balance data is displayed in a table format and a pie chart format. The table format shows a clear breakdown of the data for categories and accounts. Please note that the pie chart doesn’t display adjustments and savings because displaying it will make the pie chart inaccurate.
## Adjusting Balance
Balances can be adjusted from the income or expense tab in the home screen by using the adjust balance and inputting the adjustment amount. Adjustments made in the income tab will be added and adjustments made in the expense tab will be deducted. Your adjustment history will be shown in “Balance adjustments” section of the app.
## Savings
Any amount from the total budget can be transferred to the “Savings” section of the app using the transfer to savings from the overview tab in the home screen. The savings section displays and tracks your progress for various financial goals.
